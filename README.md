This is an implementation of a
[microsimulation model for epidimics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953621007930)
called ASPICS (Agent-based Simulation of ePIdemics at Country Scale). The
project is split into two pieces -- the **initialisation pipeline** combines
various data sources to describe a synthetic population for some study area, and
then the **simulation** models the spread of COVID through that population.

## Status

We aim for this repository to provide an easy-to-use code base for building
similar research, but this is still in progress. File an
[issue](https://github.com/dabreegster/rampfs/issues) if you're interested in
building off this work.

- [x] initialisation produces a snapshot for different study areas
- [x] basic simulation with the snapshot
- [x] home-to-work commuting
- [ ] large-scale events
- [ ] calibration / validation

## Lineage

The history of this project is slightly convoluted:

1. RAMP was originally written in R, then later converted to Python and OpenCL:
   [https://github.com/Urban-Analytics/RAMP-UA](https://github.com/Urban-Analytics/RAMP-UA)
2. The "ecosystem of digital twins" branch heavily refactored the code to
   support running in different study areas and added support for commuting:
   [https://github.com/Urban-Analytics/RAMP-UA/tree/Ecotwins-withCommuting](https://github.com/Urban-Analytics/RAMP-UA/tree/Ecotwins-withCommuting)
3. This separate repository was created to port the initialisation logic to
   Rust, following the above branch
4. The Python and OpenCL code for running the model (after initialisation) was
   copied into this repository from
   [https://github.com/dabreegster/RAMP-UA/commits/dcarlino_dev](https://github.com/dabreegster/RAMP-UA/commits/dcarlino_dev)
   and further cleaned up

There are many contributors to the project through these different stages; the
version control history can be seen on Github in the other repositories.
